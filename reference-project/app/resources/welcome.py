Dynamic Resource Example: Welcome Message

Demonstrates a function-based resource with static content.
This is registered as a dynamic resource (function-based) but returns
constant content, making it behave like a static resource.

Note: FastMCP has two resource types:
- Static resources: Class-based (TextResource, FileResource)
- Dynamic resources: Function-based (like this one)
